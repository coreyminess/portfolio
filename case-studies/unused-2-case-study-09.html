          <h3 class="fw3 f3 open-sans fw3 pb0 best-blue">Background</h3>
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray pb2">Five and Pine was a company I built to represent my freelance work as a separate business entity. I operated under my legal name as a freelance for some time and wanted to change things up to better represent myself, as well as to get taste of what owning a small business entails, in all its taxable glory.</p>
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray pb4">I continued my work as Five and Pine up until recently, with a new full-time position as a lead designer for a local SaaS / marketing agency. This ultimately took priority, finding myself eventually disengaged from generating leads, maintaining client relationships and the many hats one must wear when working as a freelancer and a freelance business owner.</p>

          <h3 class="fw3 f3 open-sans fw3 pb0 best-blue">Branding and Identity</h3>
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray pb2">Despite this inherit closing of the company, it was an incredible experience developing leads, engaging clients, and ultimately creating a wide range of marketing collateral for numerous small to medium size businesses alike. Much of the work involved design and creative work involving the creation of landing pages, social media campaigns, custom email design, letterhead documents, one-pagers and other screen and print collateral.</p>

          <h4 class="fw6 f5 ttu open-sans fw3 pb0 dark-gray">Early Stage</h4>
          <p class="f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray pb4">The Five and Pine brand developed over time, eventually settling into a final style, reflected closely off my mountain and woodsy, Pacific Northwest inspiration I find myself surrounded by. The Five and Pine wordmark was made to resemble vintage script typography. Over the course of several rounds of creative iterations, using compiled reference images and style references, I was eventually able to design and dial-in a hand-drawn, vintage logo I felt was suitable for a company I wished to grow and develop.</p>

          <h4 class="fw6 f5 ttu open-sans fw3 pb0 dark-gray">Later Iterations</h4>
          <p class="f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray pb4">The vintage aesthetic carried over into other aspects of company branding including the website, social media ads and material as well as other client facing collateral. Much of the styles playing closely off the mountain and forest motifs common throughout Pacific Northwest.</p>
