          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">We had the opportunity to work on a range of First Union customer-facing marketing collateral including custom HTML emails and landing page to kick-off an upcoming product and brand launch.</p>
          <h3 class="fw3 f3 open-sans fw3 pb0 best-blue">Background</h3>
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">First Union was a new player on the block, evolving their existing ecosystem into a new banking platform, evolving the future of online credit. They were nearing product launch and needed a landing page online quickly to help accelerate marketing efforts.</p>
          <h4 class="fl fw6 f5 ttu open-sans fw3 pb0 dark-gray">Initial Exploration</h4>
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">The initial concepts were well received, giving us the go ahead to continue flushing out the remaining sections and functionality. We built a variety of layout and modal options in these next iterations, hoping to understand how the site can apply to mobile. Which eventually cut back on some initial design decisions due to the tight timeline.</p>

          <img src="https://d1rnfttkuep1vk.cloudfront.net/fiu/FirstUnion-Website-v1Homepage_ScrollNAV_Drawer_v2.jpg" class="fl " alt="">
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">The landing page was designed and developed in-house by the internal team at Lightboard. With product launch approaching quickly, we had to hit the ground running, knocking out an effective, responsive website that communicates First Union’s brand standards and company vision, in just over a week.</p>

          <h4 class="fl fw6 f5 ttu open-sans fw3 pb0 pt4-l dark-gray">Full Website</h4>
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">Once that was signed off by our client, we flushed out the full web-page, resubmitting for approval before development. Some design elements were eventually scrapped with the tight timeline, such as the carousel blog articles with transparent overlay, as well as a rotating team member section. The site still maintained much of the interactivity intact despite these changes</p>
