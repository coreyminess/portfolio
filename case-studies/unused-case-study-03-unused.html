          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">For the past year, I had the pleasure of working for Lightboard as the in-house lead designer. It was an incredible experience working in both the marketing and software side of a new agency model, providing marketing collateral for a wide variety of companies, large and small.</p>
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">Though most of my tasks involved client work, I did manage to do some internal illustrations as the product as the company grew. It was great seeing the brand evolve over time to match the goals and future. </p>

        <div class="fl w-70">
          <h3 class="fw3 f3 open-sans fw3 pb0 best-blue">Illustrations</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="fl w-100 ">
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">Lightboard was still a relatively new company when I started. There wasn’t a set style or look going in. At the earlier stages of my employment, we were able to hone in on something that we felt that was able to effectively represent the brand aesthetic and integrity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="fl w-100">
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">Early in the process, we looked to define a cohesive visual style. Of these initial illustrations, we used a monochromatic, monoline style utilizing the Lightboard primary blue. This was initially built to flush closely to the existing site and the limited color palette at the time. The style ultimately didn’t stick but offered a solid foundation to build future concepts and iterations upon.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="fl w-100">
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">Later versions of the icons used a similar monoline aesthetic, mixed with a typical flat, web illustration style. The linework supported the overall shapes, effectively working as both standalone, small icons, and at larger sizes for internal, web and communicative use.</p>

          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">As a part of Lightboard’s internal software offering, we eventually carried over our illustrations into icons to represent each phase of customer design projects. These would be seen online with our marketing landing page, as well as the internal platform when requesting a project.</p>

          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">The Lightboard robot was created to convey the design process, from ideation to creation of marketing collateral. The system symbolizes the systematic ease of use the Lightboard platform provides, effectively differentiate the product from competitors in the marketplace.</p>

          <h4 class="fl fw6 f5 ttu pt5 open-sans fw3 dark-gray">Blog Illustrations</h4>
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">As a part of our content marketing campaign, we began to push internal blog posts offering useful advice and tips to marketers and would-be designers alike. With this, we decided this could be a great place to utilize the illustrations as both a client facing marketing tool, and secret sauce to a good blog post. The newly defined style was carried over into existing blog illustrations, and internal icons.</p>

          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">One of our existing, ongoing projects involves giving back to our favorite people.

          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">The following are from a set of coloring pages incorporated into one of our free giveaways. With it's ongoing status, I hope to post future updates on this project once it's fully launched.</p>

          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray pb5">It was a pleasure working on the internal Lightboard illustrations and watching the product, and illustration style evolve over time.
