          <!-- <h2 class="fl f1 fw6 open-sans fw3 ttu best-blue">CREATE DEEPER RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS</h2> -->
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">We had the opportunity to provide a new take on an existing brand style for a mobile dating application. This application, unlike some of most mainstream counterparts, was geared toward matching individuals that share similar mindful and holistic qualities. We had a rough idea of the needed direction, but needed dig deeper in order to find an effective visual style. to do a quick discovery phase, honing in on the precise vision, and visual style. We were eventually able to hone in and expand upon that style over the course of time, providing a range of cohesive icons and illustrations.</p>
          <h3 class="fw3 f3 open-sans fw3 pb0 best-blue">Discovery</h3>
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">The client had some existing illustrations currently in place for the iOS app and website. We eventually decided for expand upon this existing style, presenting a fresh take on the existing branding. For the initial discovery session, we presented a range of visual styles completed in-house at Lightboard as well as other outside sources. We were able to hone in on a desired aesthetic, further diving into concept sketches and loose illustrations to ease closer toward our intended vision.</p>
          <h4 class="fl fw6 f5 ttu open-sans fw3 pb0 dark-gray">Reference Images</h4>
          <img src="https://d1rnfttkuep1vk.cloudfront.net/mm/mm-ref.jpg" alt="mindful reference images">
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">We kicked things off exploring possible scenarios to act as both style and direction explorations. We need to find the perfect visual style, and compositions to match the brand. Ultimately, the first pass was a solid exploration but wasn’t quite the needed style. This lead us to change gears, expanded on a new color palette and concept.</p>

          <h4 class="fl fw6 f5 ttu open-sans fw3 pb0 dark-gray">Finalized Style</h4>
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">Eventually, we were able to dial in the initial explorations, using a newly supplied color palette and line-style. We eliminated the textures, muted tones as well as teepee elements in favor of something mindful and modern. We locked down a revised visual style, feeling that these new improvements could lend to the success of future icons and illustrations.</p>

          <h3 class="fw3 f3 open-sans fw3 pb0 best-blue">Feature and Profile Icons</h3>
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">
          The level of detail deviated slightly for each type of illustration and icon set we were tasked to create. With the Meet Mindful feature icon set, we pushed for a cleaner line aesthetic than previous projects, also including splashes of brand color throughout in order to implement on a variety of background colors – a common problem for monoline illustration styles.</p>

          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">
          This minimal and refined style worked significantly well for viewing on mobile devices and desktop computers alike. We eventually included the surrounding, decorative elements to further reinforce the mindfulness aspect to the set of icons and create continuity between each piece in the set.</p>

          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">
          For each user profile, there are several categories that help match individuals based on holistic and mindful principles. Each user picks the applicable categories to display on the profile to convey import lifestyle choices. We were looking to give the existing icons a facelift, utilizing our defined illustration styles, digging deep into concept exploration over the course of several iterations in order to accurately display each profile category.</p>

          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray pb5">
          This series of projects was an incredible experience to be a part of. We were able to establish and fine tune a meaningful brand aesthetic that effectively communicated the brand vision and personality. It was a successful process and discovery that we hope to continue and expand upon in future iterations of the Meet Mindful brand.</p>
