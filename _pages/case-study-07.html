          <!-- <h2 class="fl f1 fw6 open-sans fw3 ttu best-blue">CREATE DEEPER RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS</h2> -->
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray pb4">We had the opportunity to work with AutoCAD and AutoDesk on a number of projects throughout the course of my employment at Lightboard. Our internal team provided a wide range of marketing collateral for the folks over in the San Francisco office, ranging from custom illustration, social media ads as well as a variety of other internal communication collateral.</p>
          <h3 class="fw3 f3 open-sans fw3 pb0 best-blue">Background</h3>
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">Our network of designers put together some great work and even implemented an effective visual style for the brand moving forward. During this time, I was able to work on some great projects, providing a range of custom illustrations to be displayed on the Autodesk blog featuring articles pertaining to the industry leading 2D / 3D CAD software.</p>
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray pb4">During initial illustration explorations, images ranged in visual styles to fit the mood and direction for each, specific blog article.</p>

          <h3 class="fw3 f3 open-sans fw3 pb0 best-blue">Blog Article 1</h3>
          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">One of the earlier projects was an illustrated series of blog images pertaining to 5 tools of innovation. Our main goal was to execute a hand-drawn, loose aesthetic with colors and style to match the provided reference images.</p>

          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">Number 17 in the series involved concepts evolving around the future of software, maximizing financial gains and productivity. Adopted by manufacturing industries, farming and agriculture, software automation can increase efficiency in both production and distribution of tangible goods, one of the main concepts we hoped to convey.</p>

          <p class="f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">This blog post was a personal favorite. We were looking to personify the specific software for a guest post on the Autodesk blog. This was relating to grabbing quality data and gauging compiled metrics. For an interesting visual approach, we decided to personify several baseball-related scenarios in which data could be captured, witnessed or analyzed.</p>
          <p class="f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">Our initial sketches offered some loose visual concepts we could carry over into a final product. While the concepts functioned successfully, they were over the top in detail. We put together a new set of sketches, eventually locking down accurate renderings prior to vector illustration.</p>

          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray">This was a fun project for AutoCAD revolving around the popularity of basketball in the month of March. We kicked things off with an initial branding and visual exploration, finally moving on to several social media images acting as a new identity for the series. The main marketing tool in this continued series, was a March Madness basketball bracket complete with native AutoCAD tools and hotkeys for aspiring CAD designers.</p>

          <p class="fl f4 open-sans fw3 lh-copy p-gray pb4">This was an illustrated concept to in hopes to lock down a visual style for future blog posts. With this new consistency, our goal was to provide a style that was easy to implement and cost effective. We stumbled upon this line drawn art with brand colors and typography. This test-drive image involved personifying the tool panel tools inside AutoCAD software.</p>
